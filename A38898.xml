         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This makes us give you now a Naration of a bleſſed Victory which God hath given us upon the Army of the Cavaleers, and of thoſe evill perſons, who upon Sunday the 23 of this inſtant, ingaged His Majeſtie in a dangerous and bloody fight againſt His faithfull Subjects, in the Army raiſed by Authority of Parliament, for the preſervation of His Crowne and Kingdome; Wee marched from <hi>Worſter,</hi> Wenſday the 19, upon intelligence that their Army was moved from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> and bending Southward, our Traine of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was ſo unready, through want of Draught Horſes, and through other omiſſions of Monſter <hi>du Boys,</hi> that we were forced to leave it beinde to follow us, and with it the regiments of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Grantham;</hi> and ſtaying for it, wee could advance no further then to a little Market-towne called <hi>Kyneton</hi> in <hi>Warwick ſhire,</hi> ſix miles from <hi>Warwick,</hi> whether we came the Saturday night with 11. regiments of Foote, 42 Troops of Horſe, and about 700.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30380:3"/>we had Newes brought us, that the Enemy was two miles from us, upon a high Hill, called <hi>Edge-Hill:</hi> Whereupon we preſently marched forth into a great broad field under that Hill, called the vale of the red Horſe, and made a ſtand ſome half a mile from the foote of the Hill, and there drew into Battalio, where we ſaw their Forces come downe the Hill, and draw likewiſe into Battell in the bottome, a great broad company: Their Forces appeared to be much greater then we could poſſibly have conceived them to be; by the confeſſion of the priſoners we have taken, they that ſay leaſt, ſay Fourteene thouſand, which is the Earle of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's</hi> relation, who was their Generall; but others ſay, eighteene thouſand, and above 4000 Horſe and Dragoons: the winde was much for their advantage, and they indeavoured to get it more, which to prevent, we were inforced to draw out our left Wing to a great bredth, and by that means, before the Battell was done,<note place="margin">Thoſe two Regiments were led on by Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> and were of his Brigado.</note> gained it wholly from them: In our right wing were three regiments of Horſe, the Lord Generalls commanded by Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Batfores,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fieldings,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Meldrums</hi> Brigado had the Van, Colonell <hi>Pſſex</hi> was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and Colonell <hi>Ballards</hi> with the Lord Generalls regiment, his own, the Lord <hi>Brookes,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> in the reare: In the left Wing were 24 troopes of Horſe, commanded by Sir <hi>Iames Ramſey,</hi> their Commiſſary Generall. In this poſture we ſtood, when th'other Army advanced towards us, the ſtrength of their Horſe were on their right Wing oppoſite to our left; In their left Wing they had but ten troopes, but their Foote which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us, divided into nine great bodies, came up all in Front, and after ſome playing with the Canon on both ſides, that part of it which was on their left, and towards our right Wing, came on very gallantly to the Charge, and were as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly received, and charged by Sir <hi>Phillip Stapletons</hi> and Sir <hi>William Balfores</hi> Regiments of Horſe, aſſiſted with the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> and Sir <hi>William Conſtables</hi> Regiments of Foote, who did it ſo home thrice together, that they forced all the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers of two of their beſt Regiments to runne in and ſhrowd themſelves within their Pikes, not daring to ſhoote a ſhoote, and ſo ſtood: When our reare came up, and then charging all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially that part of our reare which was placed upon

               </gap>in by a Gentleman of the Lord Generals Troop of Horſe, who did much other good ſervice that day, and the Standard taken, which was afterwards by the Lord Generall himſelf delivered unto his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Mr. <hi>Chambers,</hi> with an intention to ſend it back the next day unto His Majeſty, but the Secretary after he had carried it long in his hand, ſuffered it to be taken away by ſome of our Troopers, and as yet we cannot learn where it is: The other two Regiments of our Rear, Collonel <hi>Hollis,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Ballard,</hi> charged thoſe which were before them and then the whole body of the Kings Foot, except two other Regiments, ran away: by this time it grew ſo late and darke, and to ſay the truth, our Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this preſent was all ſpent, that we contented our ſelves to make good the field, and gave them leave to retire up the Hill in the night: But before we come to this, we wil give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what paſſed in the other parts of our Army, before our Rear came up to charge. Our battaile at the very firſt wholly disbanded and ran away, without ever ſtriking ſtroke, or ſo much as being charged by the enemy, though Collonel <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf, and others that commanded thoſe Regiments, in chief, did as much as men could do to ſtay them; but Collonel <hi>Eſſex</hi> being forſaken by his whole Brigado, went himſelfe into the Van, where both by direction, and his own execution he did moſt gallant ſervice, till he received a ſhot in the thigh, of which he is ſince dead: Now for our Rear, thus it was; before it towards the outſide of it ſtood our left Wing of Horſe, advanced a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the top of a hill, where they ſtood in a Battalio lined with commanded Muſquetiers, 400 out of Collonel <hi>Hollis</hi> Regiment, and 200. out of Collonel <hi>Ballards;</hi> but upon the firſt charge of the Enemy they wheeled about, abandoned their Muſquetiers and came running down with the Enemies Horſe at their heeles,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30380:4"/>and amongſt them pell mell, juſt upon Collonel <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brake through it, though Collonel <hi>Hollis</hi> himſelf, when he ſaw them come running towards him, went and planted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt in the way, and did what poſſibly he could do to make them ſtand, and at laſt prevailed with three Troops to wheel a little about and tally; but the reſt of our horſe of that Wing, and the Enemies horſe with them, brake thorough, and ran to <hi>Kineton,</hi> where moſt of the Enemy left purſuing them, and fell to plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Waggons, by which many of us have received very great loſſe, and by name, your ſervants that now write to you: Notwithſtanding their breaking thorough Col. <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not diſmaid, but together with th'other regiments of that Brigado marched up the hill, and ſo made all the haſte they could to come to fight, and got the wind of the enemy, and came on (if we may ſay it our ſelves, but we muſt do the ſouldiers right) moſt gallantly, and charged the Enemy, who were then in fight with our Van, and the right Wing of our horſe, and as it was ſaid before, helpt to defeat the two regiments forementioned, and made all the reſt run, but two other regiments which retired orderly, and at laſt made a ſtand, and having the aſsiſtance of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and a ditch before them held us play very handſomly: And by this time it grew ſo dark, and our Powder and Bullet ſo ſpent, that it was not held fit we ſhould advance upon them; but there we ſtood in very good order, drew up all our forces both horſe and foor, and ſo ſtood all the night upon that place where the enemy before the fight had drawn into Battalio, till toward morning that the Enemy was gone, and retired up the hill: And then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alſo to a warmer place neer <hi>Kineton,</hi> where we had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the night before, for we were almoſt ſtarved with cold in that bitter night, our Army being in extream want of Victuals: And about nine or ten of the clocke drew out againe into Bat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
